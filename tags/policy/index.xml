      <description>Does coastal weather risk affect the socioeconomic structures of coastal communities? Environmental disasters, whether natural or anthropogenic, create shocks and disruptions in local economies. The long-term socio-economic well-being of coastal communities includes economic resilience â€“ the ability of local economies to withstand the impacts of environmental disasters. A conventional wisdom in economics is that economic diversity promotes stability, by allowing for the local economy to be less sensitive to exogenous fluctuations.</description>

      <description>International Parliamentary Fellowship, German Parliament (Bundestag)
In the Spring of 2018, I was one of eight Americans chosen to be part of an international program at the German Bundestag. 116 Fellows from 40 countries got to experience the German parliamentary democracy up-close: from the formation of the new Grand Coalition government to the setting of the federal budget. Fellows are paired with a Member of Parliament (MdB) and work closely in their office to gain insight in the day-to-day operation of the German government.</description>
